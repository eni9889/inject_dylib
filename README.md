## inject_dylib

Inject_dylib (indy) allows you to load a dynamic library and start a thread in
another process. Indy currently supports targetting 32-bit and 64-bit x86
processes, interoperates with the sandbox, and has been tested on OS X 10.10.

```C
#include "indy.h"

const char *str = "Hello world!";

struct indy_error err;
struct indy_info info = {
    .pid = 1234,
    .dylib_path = "/path/to/libfoo.dylib",
    .dylib_entry_symbol = "foo_entry",
    .user_data = (void *) str,
    .user_data_size = strlen(str) + 1
};

if (!indy_inject(&info, &err))
    fprintf(stderr, err.descr, err.os_ret);

// And in your dynamic library:
void foo_entry(struct indy_info *info) {
    const char *str = info->user_data;
    printf("%s\n", str);
}
```

### Security restrictions

For your application to be able to do code injection, it needs to be code
signed by a certificate in the system keychain. Either create a self-signed
certificate in the system keychain and reboot, or sign up for the Apple
Developer program to get an Apple signed certificate. The latter is probably a
requirement if you wish to distribute your application.

In addition, add the following key to your application Info.plist:

```XML
<key>SecTaskAccess</key>
<array>
    <string>allowed</string>
</array>
```

Alternatively, you can use a privileged helper. Either way, it is probably wise
to restrict this kind of access to a separate helper executable within your
application bundle.

The injector process currently cannot have App Sandbox enabled.

### Technical details

Indy is inspired by [mach_inject], but takes a very different approach,
abstracts away more details, and adds support for different target achitectures
and the app sandbox.

Indy copies a small architecture specific loader into the target process, and
starts a Mach thread. The loader does roughly the following:

```C
extern struct indy_info info;

static void close_port()
{
    mach_port_deallocate(mach_task_self(), info.port);
}

static void main()
{
    sandbox_extension_consume(info.dylib_token);

    info.handle = dlopen(info.dylib_path, RTLD_LOCAL);
    if (info.handle != NULL) {
        indy_entry entry = dlsym(info.handle, info.dylib_entry_symbol);
        if (entry != NULL)
            entry(&info);
        dlclose(info.handle);
    }

    close_port();
}

void entry()
{
    int ret = pthread_create(&info.thread, NULL, main, NULL);
    if (ret != 0)
        close_port();
    thread_terminate(mach_thread_self());
}
```

Indy hides much of the intricate detail from the user. This listing excludes
architecture specific setup. Before the user entry point runs, a proper pthread
is created. By using regular dynamic loader calls, the library is free to pull
in other library dependencies.

The loader code, info structure and runtime data are all allocated in a single
block, which can later be deallocated if the injected code decides to never
return to the loader.

To find the various system functions in the target process address space, indy
looks for the dynamic loader first, and uses its debugger interface to iterate
libraries. Indy then parses Mach-O to locate the actual functions and creates a
table for the loader to reference. The functions used in the loader are all
libSystem functions, which are currently guaranteed to be linked into every
process on OS X.

A Mach port is setup, with a receive right on the injector and send right in
the target process, allowing the two to communicate. This is also crucial to
determine actual success on the injector.
